INTRODUCTION & PROJECT NAME
------------

able-speak is a non-verbal communication application that gives the user the ability to drag and drop images to form a basic sentence. Once the images are in place you can click the microphone and the sentence will be read out to you. This web application should also be accessible on a mobile or tablet device. To restrict ourselves to small sentences that are easy to build we have decided that the app should be used to communicate basic needs in a home setting, however the app could be expanded to other settings, for example a classroom setting or whilst travelling.

What does it do and what does it solve?

We understand how frustrating it is for non-verbal communicators to connect with loved ones and those around them, so we've developed the able-speak app to bring people together and help transform their lives. This app was designed not only to help boost confidence and reduce isolation for non-verbal people, but also to give them a voice. It’s time for everybody to be heard.

What are the key features of your system?

Selected images can be dragged and dropped to form a sentence. Once they are placed in the designated container a microphone button plays the audio files when clicked.

AVAILABLE SCRIPTS
-----------
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

** Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
Anytime you need to return to the homepage you can press “R” and navigate to the rest of the pages. In some cases, it might take a little while to load. 

Preferably use a browser but if from a mobile phone, on the food/drinks page, you would need to press and hold in order to get to the relative page and you can use its navigation system to go back. Also on the food/drinks page, you would need to click in order to “scroll down” to see more.
